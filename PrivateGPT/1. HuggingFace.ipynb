       "'A sweet potato is a root vegetable that is native to Central and South America. Unlike regular potatoes, which are often white or yellow, sweet potatoes are usually orange, but can also be purple, white, or brown. They have a sweet, starchy taste and are rich in nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin C, and dietary fiber. Sweet potatoes are a common food in many parts of the world and can be prepared in a variety of ways, including baking, boiling, mashing, and frying. They are often used in both sweet and savory dishes.'"
