Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced\\nguards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.\\nWinston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was\\nadvisable to wear when facing the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen.

Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into\\nhis breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions,\\nthough not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.\\nThe hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor\\ndisplay, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of\\na man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for\\nthe stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the\\nelectric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate\\nWeek. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right\\nankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with\\nthe enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes\\nfollow you about when you move.

The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of\\nthe right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still\\ndistinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of\\nshutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body\\nmerely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party.

By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well\\nback, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be heard,\\nof course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual\\ngeography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do.\\nBut it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. It was a peculiarly\\nbeautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been\\nmanufactured for at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much older than that.\\nHe had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what\\nquarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess\\nit. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops ('dealing on the free market', it was called),\\nbut the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and razor blades,\\nwhich it was impossible to get hold of in any other way.

At the time he was not conscious of\\nwanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase. Even with nothing written\\nin it, it was a compromising possession.\\nThe thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there\\nwere no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at\\nleast by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to\\nget the grease off. The pen was an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured\\none, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved\\nto be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil.

It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate\\nWeek. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right\\nankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with\\nthe enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes\\nfollow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.\\nInside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of\\npig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of\\nthe right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still\\ndistinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of\\nshutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body\\nmerely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face\\nnaturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that\\nhad just ended.\\nOutside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind\\nwere whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there\\nseemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The\\nblackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front\", metadata={'source': './files/chapter_one.pdf'}),\n",

To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting, and which, when the\\nflats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well\\nback, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be heard,\\nof course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual\\ngeography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do.\\nBut it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. It was a peculiarly\\nbeautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been\\nmanufactured for at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much older than that.\\nHe had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what\\nquarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess\\nit. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops ('dealing on the free market', it was called),\\nbut the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and razor blades,\\nwhich it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He had given a quick glance up and down the street\\nand then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious of\\nwanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase. Even with nothing written\\nin it, it was a compromising possession.\\nThe thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there\\nwere no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at\\nleast by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to\\nget the grease off. The pen was an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured\\none, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved\\nto be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to\\nwriting by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything into the speakwrite which was\", metadata={'source': './files/chapter_one.pdf'})]"
