Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced\\nguards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.\\nWinston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was\\nadvisable to wear when facing the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen.

Winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to\\nget the grease off. The pen was an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured\\none, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved\\nto be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil.

It was partly the unusual\\ngeography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do.\\nBut it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. It was a peculiarly\\nbeautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been\\nmanufactured for at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much older than that.\\nHe had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what\\nquarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess\\nit. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops ('dealing on the free market', it was called),\\nbut the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and razor blades,\\nwhich it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He had given a quick glance up and down the street\\nand then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious of\\nwanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase. Even with nothing written\\nin it, it was a compromising possession.\\nThe thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there\\nwere no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at\\nleast by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to\\nget the grease off. The pen was an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured\\none, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved\\nto be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to\\nwriting by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything into the speakwrite which was\", metadata={'source': './files/chapter_one.pdf'})]"
